CVIP projects:
Project 1: Image Features and Image Processing
extract SIFT features and draw the keypoints for both images.


Project 2:
Epipolar-Geometry
Find keypoint in the left and right image,calculate fundamental matrix ,Randomly select 10 inlier match pairs. For each keypoint in the left image, compute the epiline and draw on the right image.Calculate Disparity Map

K_Mean-clustering
Clustering image coordinate into three cluster and color quantinzation of image

Project 3:
EdgeDetection
Detect edges in the Image Write programs to detect edges in Fig. 1 (along both x and y directions) using Sobel operator. In your report, please include two resulting images, one showing edges along x direction and the other showing edges along y direction.
KeypointDetection
Detect key points in the input image using SIFT Write programs to detect keypoints in an image according to the following steps, which are also the rst three steps of Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT).
